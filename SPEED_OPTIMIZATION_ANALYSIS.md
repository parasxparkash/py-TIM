### 2. Specific Optimization Strategies

#### A. Cython Implementation Strategy

```cython
# Example: High-performance RSI implementation
@cython.boundscheck(False)
@cython.wraparound(False)
def rsi_cython(double[:] data, int period):
    cdef int i, n = data.shape[0]
    cdef double alpha = 1.0 / period
    cdef double avg_gain = 0.0, avg_loss = 0.0
    cdef double change, gain, loss, rs
    cdef double[:] result = np.empty(n, dtype=np.float64)
    
    # C-speed implementation with typed variables
    # Expected 10-15x speedup over current Python implementation
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates Python interpreter overhead
- Direct C-level array access
- Optimized arithmetic operations
- Memory locality improvements

#### B. NumPy Vectorization Enhancements

**Rolling Operations Optimization:**
```python
# Current: Loop-based standard deviation (slow)
for i in range(period - 1, len(data)):
    subset = data[i - period + 1:i + 1]
    std_values[i] = np.std(subset, ddof=0)

# Optimized: Stride-based rolling std (5-8x faster)
from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import sliding_window_view
windows = sliding_window_view(data, window_shape=period)
std_values = np.std(windows, axis=1)
```

#### C. Specialized Algorithms

1. **Welford's Online Algorithm** for rolling variance/std
2. **Kahan Summation** for improved numerical stability
3. **SIMD Intrinsics** for parallel arithmetic operations
4. **Memory Pool Allocation** for reduced garbage collection

### 3. Advanced Optimization Techniques

#### A. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation with Numba

```python
import numba
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True, cache=True)
def ema_numba(data, period):
    # Numba-optimized implementation
    # Expected 8-12x speedup with minimal code changes
```

**Advantages:**
- Easier implementation than Cython
- Automatic optimization
- Good performance gains
- No compilation setup required

#### B. GPU Acceleration with CuPy/CUDA

```python
import cupy as cp

def sma_gpu(data, period):
    gpu_data = cp.asarray(data)
    result = cp.convolve(gpu_data, cp.ones(period)/period, mode='valid')
    return cp.asnumpy(result)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Large datasets (>100k points)
- Batch processing multiple indicators
- Real-time trading systems
- **Expected improvement**: 50-100x for large datasets

#### C. Multi-threading and Parallel Processing

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import numpy as np

def parallel_indicator_calculation(data_chunks, indicator_func):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(indicator_func, data_chunks))
    return np.concatenate(results)
```
